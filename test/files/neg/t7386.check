MyScalaClass.scala:3: error: value myStaticBaseMethod is not a member of object MyClass
did you mean myStaticBaseMethead?
did you mean MyClassBase.myStaticBaseMethod? Static Java members belong to companion objects in Scala;
they are not inherited, even by subclasses defined in Java.
  MyClass.myStaticBaseMethod() //no compiles. Wrong!!!
